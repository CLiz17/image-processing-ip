# Image Processing on a Zynq ZedBoard FPGA
Using the Neighborhood Processing with a 3 x 3 kernel

### Image processing IP is divided into 3 modules and then integrating them all to simulate
1. Design of Line Buffer
2. Design of Multiply Accumulate Unit
3. Control Logic

### Package the modules 

### Then simulate the IP Packages

#### Simulation on Xilinx Vivado
