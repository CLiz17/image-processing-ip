# Image Processing on a Zynq ZedBoard FPGA
Using the Neighborhood Processing with a 3 x 3 kernel

### Image processing IP is divided into 4 modules and then integrating them all to simulate
1. Design of Line Buffer
2. Design of MAC (Multiplication Addition Contol)


#### Simulation on Xilinx Vivado
